## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Build Management (`ctmm_build.py`)

The enhanced build management system extends the existing `ctmm_build.py` with:

1. **Comprehensive Workflow**: `comprehensive_build_workflow()`
   - Runs complete enhanced build management
   - Provides detailed reporting with performance metrics
   - Validates CI/CD reliability

2. **Enhanced Build Management**: `enhanced_build_management()`
   - Wraps standard build with comprehensive improvements
   - Tracks automation improvements and performance metrics
   - Provides structured results with error categorization

3. **Advanced Error Categorization**: `_categorize_build_errors()`
   - Analyzes build logs for common error patterns
   - Categorizes errors by type for targeted fixes
   - Provides actionable error insights

4. **Artifact Management**: `_manage_build_artifacts()`
   - Automated cleanup of temporary files
   - Build artifact statistics and management
   - Resource optimization and cleanup

### Advanced Incremental Testing (`build_system.py`)

Enhanced incremental testing with:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time module processing performance
