## Usage

### Enhanced Build Commands

```bash
# Run enhanced build management
python3 ctmm_build.py --enhanced

# Enhanced build via Makefile
make enhanced-build

# Enhanced incremental testing
make enhanced-testing
```

### Standard Build Commands (Still Available)

```bash
# Standard build check
python3 ctmm_build.py

# Standard Makefile targets
make check
make build
make test
```

## Technical Implementation

### Enhanced Build Management (`ctmm_build.py`)

The enhanced build management system extends the existing `ctmm_build.py` with:

1. **Comprehensive Workflow**: `comprehensive_build_workflow()`
   - Runs complete enhanced build management
   - Provides detailed reporting
   - Validates CI/CD reliability

2. **Enhanced Build Management**: `enhanced_build_management()`
   - Wraps standard build with improvements
   - Tracks automation improvements
   - Provides structured results

### Advanced Incremental Testing (`build_system.py`)

Enhanced incremental testing with:

1. **Error Categorization**: Sophisticated error classification
2. **Advanced Module Isolation**: Better module testing strategy
3. **Comprehensive Reporting**: Detailed error analysis and reporting

### Resource Management Improvements

- **File Handling**: Proper file resource management to eliminate warnings
- **Memory Optimization**: Improved memory usage in validation processes
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling throughout the system

## Integration with Existing Infrastructure

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing commands and workflows remain functional
- Enhanced features are additive, not replacing existing functionality
- Standard `python3 ctmm_build.py` continues to work as before

### GitHub Actions Integration
- Enhanced build management integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- Improved error detection and reporting in automated builds
- Better artifact management and build verification

### Documentation and Developer Experience
- Enhanced Makefile targets for improved developer workflow
- Comprehensive documentation for new features
- Clear migration path for enhanced functionality

## Benefits
