# GitHub Actions YAML Syntax Fix - Issue #458

## Summary

This document describes the resolution of YAML syntax errors in GitHub Actions workflow files where the `on:` keyword was being incorrectly interpreted as a boolean value instead of a trigger configuration key.

## Problem Description

### The Issue
In YAML 1.1 specification, certain words like `on`, `yes`, `no`, `true`, `false` are interpreted as boolean literals when unquoted. This caused GitHub Actions workflow files to malfunction because:

- **Unquoted syntax**: `on:` gets parsed as the boolean `True` key
- **Expected syntax**: GitHub Actions expects the string key `"on"`

### Impact
When `on:` is unquoted, the YAML parser creates a key-value pair with the boolean `True` as the key instead of the string `"on"`. This prevents GitHub Actions from properly recognizing the workflow triggers.

## Solution Implemented

### Fix Applied
Quote the `on` keyword in all GitHub Actions workflow files to prevent YAML boolean interpretation:

```yaml
# ❌ Problematic (unquoted)
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]

# ✅ Correct (quoted)  
"on":
  push:
    branches: [main]
```

### Files Fixed
1. `.github/workflows/latex-build.yml`
2. `.github/workflows/latex-validation.yml`
3. `.github/workflows/static.yml`

## Validation Results

### Current Status
All three workflow files have been validated and confirmed to have the correct syntax:

- ✅ **latex-build.yml**: Triggers on push/pull_request to main branch
- ✅ **latex-validation.yml**: Triggers on push/pull_request to main branch  
- ✅ **static.yml**: Triggers on push to main branch and manual workflow_dispatch

### Technical Verification

```python
# Problematic parsing (unquoted)
yaml.safe_load('on:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]')
# Result: {True: {'push': {'branches': ['main']}}}
# Issue: Key is boolean True, not string "on"

# Correct parsing (quoted)
yaml.safe_load('"on":\n  push:\n    branches: [main]')  
# Result: {'on': {'push': {'branches': ['main']}}}
# Success: Key is string "on" as expected by GitHub Actions
```

## Testing

Two validation scripts were created to verify the fix:

1. **`validate_workflow_syntax.py`**: Comprehensive validation of all workflow files
2. **`test_workflow_structure.py`**: Tests GitHub Actions workflow structure compliance

Both scripts confirm that all workflow files have correct syntax and structure.

## Conclusion

The YAML syntax issue has been successfully resolved. All GitHub Actions workflow files now use the quoted `"on":` syntax, ensuring:

- Proper YAML parsing with string keys
- Correct GitHub Actions trigger recognition  
- Reliable workflow execution on push and pull request events

The fix ensures workflows will trigger correctly and prevents YAML boolean interpretation issues.
