# Issue #721 Resolution Summary

## Problem Statement
**Issue #721**: "Wie geht es weiter?" (How do we continue?)

This strategic question arose as the CTMM (Catch-Track-Map-Match) therapeutic materials system reached a mature state with comprehensive tooling, but lacked clear direction for future development. The uncertainty about development priorities and next steps created hesitation in continuing system evolution and feature development.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue in Issue #721 stemmed from:

1. **System Maturity**: CTMM had reached a stable, production-ready state with comprehensive toolsets for therapeutic documentation
2. **Therapie-Entwicklung Unsicherheit**: Unclear how to prioritize future therapeutic development when core CTMM functionality was complete
3. **Strategic Direction**: Need for structured planning to guide continued evolution of therapeutic materials and intervention techniques
4. **Resource Allocation**: Uncertainty about which therapeutic areas would provide the most value for German-speaking therapy professionals and clients
5. **German Therapeutic Context**: Need to maintain focus on German-speaking therapy environments while expanding capabilities for neurodiverse couples
6. **CTMM Methodology Maturation**: Catch-Track-Map-Match framework had proven effective but required strategic planning for advanced applications
7. **Therapeutic Professional Feedback**: Need for systematic approach to incorporating feedback from practicing therapists using CTMM materials
8. **Neurodiversität Support Evolution**: Existing tools supported basic neurodiversity needs, but advanced interventions required strategic development planning
