# Repository Cleanup Verification

This file demonstrates that the CTMM repository is now properly configured for Copilot reviews.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Binary Files Removed
- Removed PDF files (main.pdf, build/main.pdf) 
- Removed all DOCX files from therapie-material/
- Removed problematic files with spaces and special characters

### ✅ .gitignore Updated  
- Added exclusions for PDF files (*.pdf)
- Added exclusions for Office documents (*.docx, *.doc, etc.)
- Maintains exclusions for LaTeX build artifacts

### ✅ Source Files Preserved
- All LaTeX source files (.tex) remain tracked
- Python build scripts remain tracked  
- Documentation and configuration files remain tracked

## Verification

```bash
# Check that no binary files are tracked
git ls-files | grep -E '\.(pdf|docx)$' | wc -l
# Should return: 0

# Check that source files are still tracked
git ls-files | grep -E '\.(tex|py|md)$' | wc -l  
# Should return: > 20

# Verify build system can scan files
python3 ctmm_build.py
# Should show: All referenced files exist
```

## Result

The repository now contains only reviewable source files, making it fully compatible with Copilot code reviews.
