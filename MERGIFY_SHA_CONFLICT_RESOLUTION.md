# Mergify SHA Conflict Resolution - Issues #650, #661 & #829

## Problem
This document records the resolution of Mergify SHA conflicts reported in issues #650, #661, and #829.

### Issue #650 (Previous Conflict)
**Conflict Details:**
- PR #381 ("es ist nicht mehr weit") and PR #570 ("jetzt") both have head commit SHA: `350eb3cd4d2e6ed744c816017dc9ddec77a03be0`
- Mergify cannot evaluate rules when multiple PRs share the same head commit SHA
- Both PRs have `mergeable_state="dirty"` and `mergeable=false`

### Issue #661 (Previous Conflict)
**Conflict Details:**
- This PR conflicts with PR #570 with the same head commit SHA
- Mergify cannot evaluate rules on this PR due to SHA conflict
- Need to create unique SHA to resolve conflict

### Issue #829 (Current Conflict)
**Conflict Details:**
- This PR conflicts with PR #570 ("jetzt") both have head commit SHA: `67ecd0ee372fed5a53d00b4358c3bd5dc9d5f298`
- Mergify cannot evaluate rules when multiple PRs share the same head commit SHA
- Both PRs point to the same main branch commit, creating ambiguity for rule evaluation
- Need to create unique SHA to resolve conflict

## Root Cause
Multiple PRs were created from the main branch pointing to the same commit, creating ambiguity for Mergify's rule evaluation system.

## Solution
Create a new commit with a different SHA to allow Mergify to distinguish between PRs and evaluate rules properly.
