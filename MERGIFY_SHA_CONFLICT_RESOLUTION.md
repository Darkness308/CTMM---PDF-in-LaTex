# Mergify SHA Conflict Resolution - Issues #650, #661 & #884

## Problem
This document records the resolution of Mergify SHA conflicts reported in issues #650, #661, and #884.

### Issue #650 (Previous Conflict)
**Conflict Details:**
- PR #381 ("es ist nicht mehr weit") and PR #570 ("jetzt") both have head commit SHA: `350eb3cd4d2e6ed744c816017dc9ddec77a03be0`
- Mergify cannot evaluate rules when multiple PRs share the same head commit SHA
- Both PRs have `mergeable_state="dirty"` and `mergeable=false`

### Issue #661 (Previous Conflict)
**Conflict Details:**
- This PR conflicts with PR #570 with the same head commit SHA
- Mergify cannot evaluate rules on this PR due to SHA conflict
- Need to create unique SHA to resolve conflict

### Issue #884 (Current Conflict)
**Conflict Details:**
- This PR conflicts with PR #381 with head commit SHA: `1d5a37a592a3d577e741fc60f8336e8e56f68a45`
- Three-way conflict: PRs #381, #570, and #884 all share identical head commit SHA
- Mergify cannot evaluate rules when multiple PRs have the same head commit SHA
- Requires unique SHA generation to enable independent rule evaluation

## Root Cause
Multiple PRs were created from the main branch pointing to the same commit, creating ambiguity for Mergify's rule evaluation system.

## Solution
Create a new commit with a different SHA to allow Mergify to distinguish between PRs and evaluate rules properly.

## Resolution Status

### Issue #650
✅ **RESOLVED** - New commit created to resolve SHA conflict
- Previous conflicting SHA: `350eb3cd4d2e6ed744c816017dc9ddec77a03be0`
- New unique SHA: `e2fafb18ba4412d8185bbef9c72b918b89f64090`
- Mergify can now evaluate rules for this PR independently

### Issue #661  
✅ **RESOLVED** - New commit created to resolve SHA conflict with PR #570
