# Fix for Over-Escaping Issue in LaTeX Conversion

## Problem Description

The issue was identified in PR #3 where LaTeX files generated by document conversion processes contained excessive escaping sequences. Instead of clean, readable LaTeX code, commands were over-escaped with `\textbackslash{}` sequences.

## Example of the Problem

**Over-escaped (problematic) code:**
```latex
\\textbackslash{}hypertarget\\textbackslash{}{ctmm-system\\textbackslash{}}\\textbackslash{}{\\textbackslash{}%
\\textbackslash{}section\\textbackslash{}{CTMM-System\\textbackslash{}}\\textbackslash{}label\\textbackslash{}{ctmm-system\\textbackslash{}}\\textbackslash{}}
```

**Properly escaped (fixed) code:**
```latex
\hypertarget{ctmm-system}{%
\section{CTMM-System}\label{ctmm-system}}
```

## Solution

1. **Created README.tex**: A clean LaTeX version of the README using proper LaTeX formatting
2. **Eliminated over-escaping**: Used normal LaTeX backslashes instead of `\textbackslash{}` sequences
3. **Used appropriate LaTeX commands**: 
   - `\verb|...| for inline code with backslashes
   - `\texttt{...}` for simple monospace text
   - `\begin{verbatim}...\end{verbatim}` for code blocks

## Key Principles Applied

- **Readability**: LaTeX source should be human-readable and maintainable
- **Standard escaping**: Use LaTeX's built-in escaping mechanisms appropriately
- **Proper formatting**: Structure content with appropriate LaTeX environments and commands

## Files Changed

- `README.tex` - New clean LaTeX version of the documentation
- This `OVER_ESCAPING_FIX.md` - Documentation of the fix

The README.tex file demonstrates proper LaTeX formatting without over-escaping issues and serves as a template for any future document conversion processes.
