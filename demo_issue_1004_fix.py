Demonstration of Issue #1004 Fix: Package Name Sanitization

This script demonstrates how the Copilot review concern about package name 
sanitization has been resolved in the CTMM build system.

Original Issue: "The placeholder command name uses string formatting that 
could create invalid LaTeX command names if package_name contains special characters."
