## üõ†Ô∏è Enhanced Template Generation

### Intelligent Template Creation

The system now creates sophisticated templates based on file type and naming patterns:

#### Style Package Templates
- **Form Elements**: Automatically includes hyperref, form commands, and CTMM form elements
- **Design System**: Includes color definitions, tcolorbox environments, and design patterns
- **Diagrams**: Includes TikZ, pgfplots, and custom diagram styles
- **General Purpose**: Basic package structure with common dependencies

#### Module Templates
- **Arbeitsbl√§tter (Worksheets)**: Pre-configured with reflection questions, form elements, and CTMM styling
- **Trigger Management**: Includes trigger identification, coping strategies, and structured forms
- **Depression Support**: Contains mood monitoring, activity tracking, and support elements
- **General Modules**: Comprehensive module structure with interactive elements

### Enhanced TODO File System

Each generated template includes a comprehensive TODO file with:
- Context-aware completion guidelines
- CTMM integration checklists
- Step-by-step completion instructions
- Quality assurance requirements
- Testing and validation steps

## üìä Advanced Incremental Testing

### Individual Module Testing
```bash
make enhanced-testing
```

Features:
- **Isolated Environment**: Each module tested in isolation with mock CTMM environment
- **Compilation Metrics**: Timing and performance analysis
- **Error Classification**: Automatic categorization of compilation errors
- **Syntax Validation**: Fallback validation when LaTeX compiler unavailable

### Integration Testing
- **Module Compatibility**: Tests pairs of modules for conflicts
- **Conflict Detection**: Identifies command redefinitions and reference conflicts
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Full integration testing across all module combinations

### Detailed Reporting
Generated reports include:
- Module test results with performance metrics
- Integration testing outcomes
- Error categorization and analysis
- Actionable recommendations

## üéØ Automated Workflow

### Complete Automated Workflow
```bash
make automated-workflow
```

This runs the complete sequence:
1. Enhanced build management
2. Enhanced incremental testing
3. Comprehensive validation
4. Final reporting and recommendations

### Individual Components
```bash
make enhanced-build      # Enhanced build management only
make enhanced-testing    # Advanced incremental testing only
make detect-missing      # Missing file detection and template generation
make error-analysis      # Comprehensive error analysis
```

## üìã Usage Guide

### For Developers

#### Daily Development Workflow
```bash
# Quick check during development
make check

# Enhanced validation before commits
make enhanced-build

# Complete testing for major changes
make automated-workflow
```

#### Template Development
```bash
# Add new module reference to main.tex
\input{modules/new-module}

# Generate template automatically
make detect-missing

# Review generated template and TODO file
# Complete template development
# Test integration
make enhanced-testing
```

### For CI/CD Integration

#### GitHub Actions Integration
The enhanced build management integrates seamlessly with CI/CD:
- Automated missing file detection
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Build artifact validation
- Performance metrics collection

#### Error Recovery
- Automatic template generation for missing files
- Graceful degradation when LaTeX unavailable
- Comprehensive error logging and categorization
- Actionable error resolution guidance
