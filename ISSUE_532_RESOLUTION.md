# GitHub Issue #532 - Resolution Summary

## Issue Description

GitHub Issue #532 addressed a YAML syntax problem in GitHub Actions workflow files where the `on` keyword was potentially using single quotes instead of double quotes, causing YAML parsers to misinterpret the trigger keyword as a boolean value rather than the string that GitHub Actions expects.

## Problem Analysis

The issue was related to YAML 1.1 specification behavior where certain keywords like `on`, `yes`, `no`, `true`, `false` are interpreted as boolean literals when unquoted or improperly quoted:

- **Problematic**: `on:` or `'on':` could be parsed as boolean `True`
- **Required**: `"on":` must be parsed as string `"on"`

## Solution Implemented

### Current Status ✅

All GitHub Actions workflow files in the repository now use the correct double-quoted syntax:

1. **`.github/workflows/latex-build.yml`** - Line 4: `"on":`
2. **`.github/workflows/latex-validation.yml`** - Line 4: `"on":`  
3. **`.github/workflows/static.yml`** - Line 5: `"on":`

### Validation Results

Multiple validation scripts confirm the fix:

- ✅ `validate_workflow_syntax.py` - All files pass
- ✅ `test_workflow_structure.py` - All workflows valid
- ✅ `final_verification.py` - Fix demonstrated working
- ✅ `validate_issue_532.py` - Issue #532 specific validation passes

## Technical Verification

```python
# Problematic parsing (causes GitHub Actions issues)
yaml.safe_load('on:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]')
# Result: {True: {'push': {'branches': ['main']}}}
# Problem: Key is boolean True, not string "on"

# Correct parsing (Issue #532 solution)
yaml.safe_load('"on":\n  push:\n    branches: [main]')  
# Result: {'on': {'push': {'branches': ['main']}}}
# Success: Key is string "on" as expected by GitHub Actions
```

## Impact

With this fix:

- ✅ GitHub Actions correctly recognizes all workflow triggers
- ✅ Workflows trigger properly on push and pull request events
- ✅ No YAML boolean interpretation issues
- ✅ Reliable CI/CD pipeline operation

## Files Affected

- `.github/workflows/latex-build.yml` - LaTeX PDF build workflow
- `.github/workflows/latex-validation.yml` - LaTeX validation workflow
- `.github/workflows/static.yml` - GitHub Pages deployment workflow

## Resolution Status

**✅ RESOLVED** - GitHub Issue #532 has been successfully resolved. All GitHub Actions workflow files use the correct quoted `"on":` syntax, preventing YAML boolean interpretation issues and ensuring reliable workflow execution.
