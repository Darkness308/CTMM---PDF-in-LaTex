# Issue #962 Resolution - Malformed Loop Structure in Validation Scripts

## Problem Summary

**Issue #962**: Malformed loop structures causing syntax errors and code duplication in validation scripts.

The issue manifested as duplicate iteration variables and redundant code blocks in critical validation infrastructure files:
1. **validate_pr.py**: Overlapping for loops in `check_file_changes()` function with duplicate base branch detection logic
2. **validate_issue_721.py**: Malformed else statements causing syntax errors in the `main()` function

These structural problems created potential bugs, code maintenance issues, and in the case of validate_issue_721.py, actual syntax errors preventing script execution.

## Root Cause Analysis

The malformed structures resulted from:

1. **Code Evolution Without Cleanup**: Multiple approaches to base branch detection were implemented but the old code wasn't removed
2. **Missing Break Statements**: The first loop in validate_pr.py lacked proper termination logic
3. **Duplicate Logic Blocks**: Redundant code sections attempting to solve the same problem with different implementations
4. **Copy-Paste Errors**: In validate_issue_721.py, duplicate else statements were introduced during code modifications
5. **Lack of Validation**: The malformed code wasn't caught by existing validation processes

### Specific Technical Issues

**validate_pr.py (lines 50-69)**:
```python
# BEFORE: Malformed structure with duplicate logic
for base_option in base_options:
    if any(base_option in branch for branch in available_branches) or base_option == base_branch:
        success, _, _ = run_command(f"git rev-parse {base_option}")
        if success:
            actual_base = base_option
    # Missing break statement - could be overwritten by subsequent iterations

# Duplicate batch approach (lines 55-69)
filtered_options = [opt for opt in base_options if ...]
if filtered_options:
    cmd = "git rev-parse " + " ".join(filtered_options)
    # Redundant implementation of the same functionality
```

**validate_issue_721.py (lines 297-302)**:
```python
# BEFORE: Malformed else statements
def main():
    if not validate_issue_721_resolution():
        print("\\n❌ Validation failed...")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("\n❌ Validation failed...")  # Wrong message
        sys.exit(1)  # Wrong exit code
    else:  # ← SYNTAX ERROR: orphaned else
        print("\n✅ Validation successful...")
        sys.exit(0)
```

## Solution Implemented

### 1. validate_pr.py - Consolidated Base Branch Detection

**Fixed the malformed loop structure**:
```python
# AFTER: Clean, single-purpose implementation
for base_option in base_options:
    if any(base_option in branch for branch in available_branches) or base_option == base_branch:
        success, _, _ = run_command(f"git rev-parse {base_option}")
        if success:
            actual_base = base_option
            break  # ← Added proper termination
```

**Changes Made**:
- Added missing `break` statement to prevent unnecessary iterations
- Removed duplicate batch processing code block (lines 55-69)
- Consolidated logic into single, clear implementation
- Maintained all existing functionality while eliminating redundancy

### 2. validate_issue_721.py - Fixed Control Structure

**Fixed the malformed else statements**:
```python
# AFTER: Correct if-else structure
def main():
    if not validate_issue_721_resolution():
        print("\n❌ Validation failed - Issue #721 resolution needs refinement")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print("\n✅ Validation successful - Issue #721 comprehensively resolved")
        sys.exit(0)
```

**Changes Made**:
- Removed duplicate else block with incorrect logic
- Fixed success message and exit code in the correct else branch
- Restored proper function control flow
- Fixed escaped newline character
