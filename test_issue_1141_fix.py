Test Issue #1141 Fix: CI Validation Failure - LaTeX Action Version Update

This test validates that the LaTeX action version issue that caused the CI failure
in the LaTeX Validation workflow has been properly resolved.

Issue: "Unable to resolve action `dante-ev/latex-action@v2`, unable to find version `v2`"
Solution: Update to xu-cheng/latex-action@v3 (proven stable version)
