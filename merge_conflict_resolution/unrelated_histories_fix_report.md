## Resolution Strategy

Based on the repository's `MERGIFY_SHA_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` guidance, this script:

1. **Attempts rebase onto main** to establish proper history connection

3. **Preserves original changes** while fixing the history issue
4. **Follows the established pattern** from previous issue resolutions (#650, #661, #884)

## Next Steps

### For Successfully Fixed PRs:
1. The PRs now have proper history connection to main branch
2. Each PR received a unique SHA to resolve Mergify conflicts
3. PRs should now be mergeable through normal GitHub workflow
4. Consider testing with the automated PR merge workflow

### For Failed Fixes:
1. Manual intervention required
2. Consider alternative approaches:
  - Create new branch from main with the changes
  - Use `git merge --allow-unrelated-histories` manually
  - Consult with repository maintainers

### Follow-up Actions:
1. **Test the fixes** using the automated PR merge workflow
2. **Update PR descriptions** to reflect the resolution
3. **Monitor Mergify** to ensure it can now evaluate the PRs
4. **Document any additional patterns** found for future reference

## Technical Implementation

This resolution follows the same pattern as documented in:
- `MERGIFY_SHA_CONFLICT_RESOLUTION.md` (Issues #650, #661, #884)
- Creates unique SHAs through meaningful commits
- Preserves all original functionality
- Maintains repository integrity
